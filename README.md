# Mobile-Game

The majority of our users never generate any revenue (i.e., ‘convert’, in marketing parlance). We want to offer a sale to some of these ‘non-payers’, in hopes of generating incremental revenue. 

The goal of this project is to design a sale that maximizes incremental revenue. Build a model in R to identify users who are likely to convert on their own.
